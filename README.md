# Edge-AI-Cooperative-V2V
This repository hosts FastLane, an Edge-AI powered framework for real-time Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) cooperative perception and intelligent transportation safety. The project investigates how advanced object detection models can be deployed on edge devices to support safe and efficient autonomous driving through shared situational awareness.
